Our recent paper on a metre-scale vertical origami hydrogel panel for atmospheric water harvesting in Death Valley has just been published in *Nature Water*! This study demonstrates a device capable of pulling safe drinking water directly from air, enabled by shape-morphing origami hydrogels that optimize water capture and release.
