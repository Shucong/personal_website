abstract: 'Stimuli-responsive materials typically contain responsive molecular units that couple an external
trigger to a defined macroscale response. Ongoing efforts to boost the versatility and complexity
of these responses increasingly focus on multi-stimuli-responsive molecular units and
crosslinkers, as these bear the potential to impart self-regulatory behaviors building on cooperative
effects and feedback mechanisms. Herein, we study a stimuli-responsive platform consisting of
polyacrylamide-based hydrogels with well-known multi-responsive spiropyrans covalently bound
as pendant groups or ´non-innocent´ crosslinkers. Surprisingly, as compared to their appended
counterparts, spiropyran crosslinkers cause up to two-fold larger hydrogel swelling in
methylenebisacrylamide-crosslinked poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels, despite their
increased relative crosslinking density. We seek the origin of this unexpected behavior by
employing nanoindentation, swelling studies, and UV-vis spectroscopy to study changes in
mechanical properties and in spiropyran isomer distribution as a function of solution pH, comonomer chemistry, and swelling-induced polymer strain. We then estimate the osmotic
counterion pressures as a function of spiropyran isomer distribution but find that such pressures
alone are insufficient to explain the observed behavior. Charge complexation, cooperative effects
between the hydrogel´s mechanics and chemistry, and aggregate formation may all be invoked to
explain features of the observed ´non-innocence´ of spiropyran crosslinkers. Taken together,
these insights will aid rational implementation of such responsive crosslinkers in materials design
and extend the functionality of existing polymeric materials towards more complex and better
tunable behaviors.'
