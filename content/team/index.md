    <h3>Xinyi Ding</h3>
    <p><strong>G1 PhD Student</strong><br>Georgia Tech MSE</p>
    <p><strong>Education</strong><br>Fudan University, B.S. in Materials Physics, 2024</p>
    <p>In her prior research, Xinyi first focused on sonopiezoelectric nano-therapy for effective tumor eradication in Prof. Meiqi Chang’s lab. Then, she studied the synthesis and application of dual-functional ionogels possessing both ionic thermoelectric and piezoelectric properties under Prof. Ziqi Liang's guidance. Currently, Xinyi is a Ph.D. student in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. In Prof. Shucong Li's Lab, her research focuses on the design and fabrication of bio-inspired liquid crystal assemblies through advanced manufacturing techniques, ultimately developing soft materials with environmentally adaptive dynamic reconfigurations.</p>

    <h3>Haodong Wu</h3>
    <p><strong>G1 PhD Student</strong><br>Georgia Tech MSE</p>
    <p><strong>Education</strong><br>University of Science and Technology of China, M.S. in Chemistry, 2025</p>
    <p>Haodong has developed strong interests and motivation in studying polymer materials science since his undergraduate study. After entering USTC, he joined in Prof. Quan Chen’s lab, and his research focused on the elasticity and swelling behaviour of hydrogels based on tetra-armed prepolymers. Haodong has done several poster presentations in international symposiums, and his work has been widely recognized by many excellent researchers. Haodong is currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. His research in the Shucong lab will focus on smart materials including liquid crystalline elastomers and hydrogels.</p>
