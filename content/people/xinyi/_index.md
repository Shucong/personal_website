In her prior research, , Xinyi first focused on sonopiezoelectric nano-therapy for effective tumor eradication in Prof. Meiqi Changâ€™s lab. Then, she studied the synthesis and application of dual-functional ionogels possessing both ionic thermoelectric and piezoelectric properties under Prof. Ziqi Liang's guidance. Currently, Xinyi is a Ph.D. student in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. In Prof. Shucong Li's Lab, her research focuses on the design and fabrication of bio-inspired liquid crystal assemblies through advanced manufacturing techniques, ultimately developing soft materials with environmentally adaptive dynamic reconfigurations.
