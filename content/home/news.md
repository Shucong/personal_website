  Our recent paper on "A metre-scale vertical origami hydrogel panel for atmospheric water harvesting in Death Valley" has just been published in <em>Nature Water</em>! This study demonstrates a window-sized device capable of pulling safe drinking water directly from air, enabled by shape-morphing origami hydrogels that optimize water capture and release.
